Updates a frequently-changing value only once every `delay`ms

## Types

<Source language="ts" code={TYPES} />

## Examples

### Throttled counter

A very easy to see example is throttling a counter so that components that depend upon a very frequently updating value rerender a limited amount per second.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Throttled counter" story={stories.counter} />
</Canvas>

### Search books

When searching a list it may be helpful to throttle the search query. This allows a user to type at a normal speed with potentially costly filtering occurring a limited amount per second to prevent freezing.

<Canvas withSource="open">
  <Story name="Search books" story={stories.search} />
</Canvas>
