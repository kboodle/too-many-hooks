# useDeepCompareEffect

Runs an `effect` function when dependencies change, deeply compared

## Types

<Source language="ts" code={TYPES} />

## Examples

`useDeepCompareEffect` is not often used directly in the UI so it does not have a dedicated story at this time (ideas welcome).
However, it is useful in cases such as the `useThrottleFunction` hook and in other hooks still to come for reacting to changes to objects, arrays, etc.

### `useThrottleFunction`

In this case, `useDeepCompareEffect` is used to deeply check if arguments to a function have changed and if so, update the current state of the throttled value.
A normal `useEffect` may fire too often because the arguments may be reassigned on every render, but we only want to run the function when their actual values change.
