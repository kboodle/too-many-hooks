# useArray

Wrap array state with powerful helper functions for simpler updates

## Functions

- `set` - The default React state setter for the entire array.

- `clear` - Empties the array.

- `reset` - Resets the array to its initial value.

- `push` - Adds element(s) to the end of the array.

- `insertAt` - Inserts element(s) at an index, shifting the remaining elements right. If the index is out of range the elements are pushed to the end.

- `removeAt` - Removes an element at an index, shifting the remaining elements left. If the index is out of range, no change occurs.

- `removeWhere` - Removes elements from the array that meet a condition. Like JS `Array.filter` with the results applied to the array state.

- `trimToRange` - Removes elements from the array outside of a certain range. Like JS `Array.slice` with the results applied to the array state

- `updateAt` - Updates element(s) at an index. For each additional element, subsequent elements are updated.

- `updateWhere` - Updates element(s) that match a predicate.

- `updateAll` - The same functionality as JS Array.map with the results applied to the array state

- `sort` - Sorts the array by comparing each element. Like JS `Array.sort` with the results applied to the array state.

- `reverse` - Reverses the order of the elements in the array. Like JS `Array.reverse` with the results applied to the array state.
