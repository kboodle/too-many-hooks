# useForm

Manage state, validations, and submission for forms with any number of dimensions

## Utilities

The `useForm` hook comes with `buildRegisterOverride` - a utility for transforming the results of the `register` function to have custom keys, so it can be used custom input components regardless of prop names.
All that is required to register a field is a component with `ref`, `onChange`, `onBlur`, and `onFocus` props by any name.
