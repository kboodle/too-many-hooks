# Graph / useGraph

Handle state with any number of dimensions

## Graph class

To support the `useGraph` hook, a `Graph` class is provided which stores data of any dimensionality and provides utilties for interacting with that data.

## Examples

`useGraph` is useful in cases such as the `useForm` hook, where state with an unknown number of dimensions is managed.

### `useForm`

In this case, a `Graph` ref is used to track information internal to the hook for any number of fields without triggering rerenders.
Additionally, `useGraph` is used to statefully store information about each field: `errors`, `touched`, and `changed`.
